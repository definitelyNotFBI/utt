// This program implements a client that sends requests to the simple register
// state machine defined in replica.cpp. It sends a preset number of operations
// to the replicas, and occasionally checks that the responses match
// expectations.
//
// Operations alternate:
//
//  1. `readMod-1` write operations, each with a unique value
//    a. Every second write checks that the returned sequence number is as
//       expected.
//  2. Every `readMod`-th operation is a read, which checks that the value
//     returned is the same as the last value written.
//
// The program expects no arguments. See the `scripts/` directory for
// information about how to run the client.
